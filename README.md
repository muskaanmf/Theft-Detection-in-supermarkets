# Theft-Detection-in-supermarkets

The aim of this project is to give the best solution for theft detection in real or static time, where it parallelly detects the theft and notifies the owner about the theft happened. It also includes how Inceptionv3 and transfer learning are used to apply concepts like feature extraction, object detection, action detection and identification. So, thisproject is designed and developed to provide an intelligent surveillance system for detecting abnormal behaviours in Super Markets. It basically, captures the input through a digital camera, that takes a real-time video where images are captured and after processing these images, a variety of objects and frames will be extracted. After that objects will be detected in the extracted frames and tracked the objects with the help of object detection algorithms like Inception v3. Later it throws the results based on whether the activity happened as an anomaly or not via a user interface design which was built on top of the Flask framework.
